Frontend Development Guide
Prerequisites
Before you dive into the frontend codebase, it's mandatory to have a foundational understanding of the core technologies we use. We've broken them down into a logical learning order. Take your time to go through these resources.
1. React: The Foundation of Our User Interface
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows us to create reusable UI components, which is a cornerstone of our project's frontend. A solid grasp of React's fundamental concepts is essential.
What to learn: Focus on understanding components, props, state, and hooks. These are the building blocks of any React application.
Official Documentation: Please go through the official React documentation to learn these concepts: https://react.dev/reference/react
2. Next.js: The Framework for Our React Application
Next.js is a React framework that gives us a robust structure for building our web application. It provides features like routing, server-side rendering, and more, which are crucial for our project. We specifically use the App Router in Next.js.
What to learn: Once you are comfortable with React, you should learn how Next.js structures a project and handles routing with the App Router.
Official Documentation: Learn how to get started with the Next.js App Router here: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started
3. shadcn/ui: Our Component Library
For our user interface components, like buttons, forms, and dialogs, we use shadcn/ui. It's a collection of reusable components that helps us build a consistent and accessible UI quickly.
What to learn: Familiarize yourself with the available components and how to integrate them into a Next.js project.
Official Documentation: You can explore the components and their usage here: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs
4. Framer Motion: For Engaging Animations
To make our user interface more dynamic and engaging, we use Framer Motion for animations. It's a powerful animation library for React that is both easy to use and highly flexible.
What to learn: Would recommend just using AI to do this, honestly none of us really understand this. As long as you have a basic understanding of react, you should be able to use it.
Official Documentation: Get started with Framer Motion by following their official documentation: https://www.framer.com/motion/
5. Tailwind CSS: For Styling Our Components
To make our user interface more dynamic and engaging, we use Tailwind CSS for styling. It's a powerful CSS framework that is both easy to use and highly flexible.
What to learn: Would recommend just using AI to do this, honestly none of us really understand this. As long as you have a basic understanding of react, you should be able to use it.
Official Documentation: Get started with Tailwind CSS by following their official documentation: https://tailwindcss.com/docs
6. (BONUS) SSR with Next.js: For Server-Side Rendering
To make our user interface more dynamic and engaging, we use Next.js for server-side rendering. It's a powerful framework that is both easy to use and highly flexible.
What to learn: Would recommend just using AI to do this, honestly none of us really understand this. As long as you have a basic understanding of react, you should be able to use it.
Official Documentation: Get started with Next.js by following their official documentation: https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations/server-and-client-components
