This project is a Content management system for a club called Google Developer Group University of Toronto Scarborough (GDG UTSC). I am the code owner, and i want to onboard some people
  to work on this project. However, this is not a very simple project. The incoming developers might have 0 knowledge of any web dev at all, and just know basic programming like
  conditionals and loops. I need you to create a new directory of static pages under docs/ that explains a ton of things about this project. First there should be a prerequisite page that
  says that it is mandatory to understand specific concepts before working on this repo. These should be very welcoming docs by the way. They should also be structured in a
  "frontend" "backend" "firebase" "deployment" section. For frontend, they need to know https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure, we use shadcn/ui, and framer motion.



   For backend, they need to know https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started, we use firebase functions. For deployment, they need to know https://vercel.com/docs/getting-started/deploying-your-project, we use vercel.
